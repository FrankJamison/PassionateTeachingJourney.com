At this point in my doctoral journey, I don’t know what the topic of my dissertation will be, but I am starting to kick around some ideas. My initial thought was to make my dissertation topic something along the line
- [The SAMR Model: An Application in Basic Web Development](https://passionateteachingjourney.com/index.php/2023/01/20/the-samr-model-an-application-in-basic-web-development/) - This week, for Module 1, we were to design an assignment or task within a learning environment, either a school or a workplace, in a discipline or subject area with which we feel comfortable.

This promises to be an exciting journey, and the course specifics are as follows. Official Course Description This course examines the theory of human learning with
- [Multiculturalism and Social Justice](https://passionateteachingjourney.com/index.php/2022/12/10/multiculturalism-and-social-justice/) - For the signature assignment in Module 6 and Module 7, I was to design a curricular unit.

My task was to create a curriculum for teaching a social justice issue to a diverse and varied community with many different cultures.
- [Cultural Intelligence](https://passionateteachingjourney.com/index.php/2022/11/28/cultural-intelligence/) - In Module 5, we were to develop at least nine interview questions to elicit the interviewee’s understanding of cultural intelligence and self-evaluation of their own cultural intelligence. The readings provided us with definitions of cultural intelligence, an issue of global understanding and social justice, as well as a cultural intelligence scale, and an abbreviated checklist.
- [Cultural Research](https://passionateteachingjourney.com/index.php/2022/11/21/cultural-research/) - In Module 4, my task was to design a tool or an activity to aid educators (in schools, universities, or businesses/organizations) in identifying the assumptions they hold and considering the options for exploring those assumptions in a non-judgmental fashion. The activity was to be designed for a specific audience within a specific context, and I
