# Passionate Teaching Journey (2024)

I built **Passionate Teaching Journey** as a WordPress site that functions as both a long-form blog and a professional portfolio. This repo is set up as a portfolio artifact for employers, recruiters, and developers: it includes the site’s WordPress codebase plus a database dump so the site can be evaluated as a complete, realistic implementation (content structure, theme configuration, plugin stack, and performance/SEO decisions).

## At a glance

- I set up a full WordPress environment that can be reproduced locally from this repository.
- I selected and configured a modern theme system (Yuki + Yuki Blogger) to support a content-heavy blog with flexible layout control.
- I integrated the typical “real site” capabilities: SEO, analytics, forms, consent, and caching/performance.
- I maintained a staging snapshot (`staging/`) to support safe iteration and theme experimentation.

## Tech stack

- WordPress (PHP)
- MariaDB / MySQL
- Local development (Windows): Apache + MySQL via XAMPP
- Caching/performance: LiteSpeed Cache (optionally with object cache)

## Repository layout (what matters)

This repository contains two WordPress installs:

- Root install: the primary local copy
- `staging/`: a second WP install used as a staging snapshot

The main “project surfaces” are the standard WordPress customization areas:

- `wp-content/themes/` (theme and presentation)
- `wp-content/plugins/` (capabilities)
- `wp-content/uploads/` (media and plugin-generated assets)
- `wp-config.php` (runtime configuration)
- `.htaccess` (rewrite rules + LiteSpeed Cache directives)

WordPress core is included on purpose to keep this portfolio self-contained and runnable without an installer.

## What I chose to version-control (and why)

- I included a database dump (`u942215055_mnvxE.sql`) so the content and configuration can be reviewed in-context.
- I intentionally keep uploads tracked so the portfolio is visually complete.
- I ignore new SQL exports by default (see `.gitignore`) to prevent accidental large commits.

## Theme & design approach

### Themes present in this repo

- `wp-content/themes/yuki/` — primary theme
- `wp-content/themes/yuki-blogger/` — Yuki-based variant with blogger-oriented defaults
- `staging/wp-content/themes/creativ-education/` — alternate staging direction for an education-focused look

### How I implemented design (no-code/low-code first)

This build is intentionally “realistic WordPress work”: the design is driven primarily through WordPress configuration rather than bespoke frontend code.

- Theme Customizer / theme options (typography, color, layout, header/footer builders)
- Menus and widgets for navigation and layout composition
- Block editor for page/post layouts and reusable components

### Design options I considered and kept open

- Brand/identity: logo, fonts, color palette
- Layout strategy: sidebar vs full-width, grid vs list archive views
- Homepage approach: editorial feed vs a structured landing page
- Accessibility baseline: contrast, heading hierarchy, alt-text workflow

## Plugin stack (capabilities)

I integrated a pragmatic plugin set to cover the core needs of a public-facing portfolio/blog:

- `wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/` — SEO (sitemaps, metadata, indexing helpers)
- `wp-content/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/` — analytics
- `wp-content/plugins/wpforms-lite/` — forms
- `wp-content/plugins/wpconsent-cookies-banner-privacy-suite/` — cookie consent
- `wp-content/plugins/litespeed-cache/` — caching/performance
- `wp-content/plugins/optinmonster/` — marketing/lead capture tooling
- `wp-content/plugins/userfeedback-lite/` — feedback/surveys (see troubleshooting note)

Host-managed plugins are present but disabled for local stability:

- `wp-content/plugins/hostinger.disabled/`
- `wp-content/plugins/hostinger-ai-assistant.disabled/`

Staging notes:

- `staging/wp-content/plugins/` includes Contact Form 7 in addition to the root plugin set.
- `wp-content/mu-plugins/hostinger-auto-updates.php` reflects a Hostinger-managed environment.

## Performance & caching strategy

- `.htaccess` contains LiteSpeed Cache markers and standard WordPress rewrite rules.
- `wp-content/object-cache.php` is present for LiteSpeed object cache integration.

The caching posture can be dialed depending on hosting constraints:

- Page cache only (simpler, broad compatibility)
- Page + object cache (more performance headroom)
- CDN layer (best for global audiences)

## SEO & analytics posture

- `llms.txt` is generated by the SEO plugin and represents a modern “indexability support” artifact.
- Sitemaps are managed via the SEO stack.
- Analytics is integrated via MonsterInsights.

## Reproducing the site locally (Windows)

My default local workflow for this repo is XAMPP + MySQL import.

1) Start Apache + MySQL in XAMPP

2) Import the DB dump

```bat
cd /d D:\Websites\2024PassionateTeachingJourney

"C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe" -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS u942215055_mnvxE DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

"C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe" -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS u942215055_mnvxe DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

"C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe" -u root --max_allowed_packet=256M u942215055_mnvxe < u942215055_mnvxE.sql
```

3) Confirm `wp-config.php` DB values match the local MySQL instance (`DB_HOST` is set to `127.0.0.1` in this repo)

4) Open the site

- This workspace includes a VS Code task in `.vscode/tasks.json` that opens `http://2024passionateteachingjourney.localhost/`.
- A simple path-based URL also works (e.g., `http://localhost/2024PassionateTeachingJourney/`) depending on local Apache configuration.

Alternative local environments I can use for the same repo shape:

- LocalWP
- Docker
- WAMP/Laragon

The main portability constraint is WordPress’s stored absolute URLs, which typically require a serialized-safe search/replace when the domain changes.

## Deployment options I considered (production)

This project maps to common WordPress deployment models:

- Shared hosting (Hostinger-style): fastest path, tradeoff is more host-specific behavior
- VPS / managed WP: better control over caching, backups, and CI/CD-style workflows
- “Git-first WordPress”: committing `wp-content/` and using Composer/tooling for core (best engineering workflow, but less "single repo snapshot" convenient)

I kept the “full WordPress snapshot” approach here to make the portfolio reproducible with minimal external setup.

## Operational notes & troubleshooting

### Large SQL import errors

If the DB import hits packet limits, I increase `max_allowed_packet` in XAMPP’s MySQL/MariaDB config and restart MySQL.

### Known issue: UserFeedback Lite fatal error

`wp-content/debug.log` captures a production-side fatal error where `userfeedback-lite` expected a file that wasn’t present. In a local environment, I resolve this by disabling the plugin (renaming its folder) so the site can boot cleanly.

## Security & privacy notes

- `wp-config.php` and `staging/wp-config.php` contain WordPress salts/keys as checked in. For a public deployment, I rotate these and prefer environment-driven secrets.
- The database dump may include user data and URLs; I treat it as sensitive and don’t publish it publicly without sanitizing.

## What I’d do next (if this were a long-lived engineering repo)

- Move toward a “wp-content only” repo layout plus environment-specific configuration.
- Add WP-CLI scripts for consistent URL search/replace and environment provisioning.
- Formalize a content migration story (staging → production) and backups.
